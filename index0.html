              			<p>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father
                      and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Matthew 28: 19</p>
                    <p>“Every baptized person should consider that it is in the womb of the church where he is
                      transformed from a child of Adam to a child of God.” St. Vincent Ferrer</p>
                    <p>Baptism is the first Sacrament of initiation in the Catholic Church. This wonderful
                      moment of great joy in a family and/or an individual’s life, is the most important of
                      moments. Through baptism, a person is freed from original sin, made a child of God and
                      brought into His family, the Church.</p>

              			<p>Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and
                      drink his blood, you have no life in you.  Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has
                      eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my
                      blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.
                      Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on
                      me will live because of me.  This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors
                      ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.” (John 6: 53-58)</p>
                    <p>“...In this world I cannot see the Most High Son of God with my own eyes, except for His Most
                      Holy Body and Blood." St. Francis of Assisi</p>
                    <p>The sacrament of First Eucharist, or Holy Communion, is a sacrament of initiation in the
                      Catholic Church. Through this sacrament, we really, literally, actually receive the Body,
                      Blood, Soul and Divinity of Christ.  The Holy Eucharist unites us with our Lord, whom we
                      receive in this sacrament. It is, in fact, what makes us his Church.</p>

                    <p>“When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. Suddenly a sound
                      like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where
                      they were sitting. They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to
                      rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in
                      other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.”  (Acts 2: 1-4)</p>
                    <p>“If we don't teach our children to follow Christ, the world will teach them not to.” Anonymous</p>
                    <p>"And then remember that you received the seal of the Spirit; the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
                      the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and godliness, and the spirit of holy
                      fear, and preserved what you received. God the Father sealed you, Christ the Lord strengthened you,
                      and gave the earnest of the Spirit in your heart, as you have learned in the lesson from the Apostle."
                      St. Ambrose</p>
                    <p>Confirmation is one of the three sacraments of initiation in the Catholic Church. This sacrament is
                      the perfection of our Baptism. Through Confirmation, we become true witnesses to Christ, and receive
                      the grace of the Holy Spirit that was bestowed upon the Apostles on Pentecost. With the gift of the
                      Holy Spirit, Christ conquers our hearts and gives us the courage to give witness to Him in the world.
                      By His grace, the weak become strong, the downcast are lifted up, the fearful become courageous and
                      sinners become saints.</p>

              			<p>"Is there any sick among you? Let him call for the priests of the church; and let
                      them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer
                      of faith will save them” James 5:14-15</p>
                    <p>The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is provides spiritual strength and healing to
                      those who are ill or dying. It can be administered as often as necessary. Through this
                      sacrament, we receive the grace to be in union with the Passion of Christ, so our suffering
                      will be holy, and the grace to prepare for death. If the anointed was not able to go to
                      Confession, Anointing also provides forgiveness of sins.</p>

              			<p>“Receive the Holy Spirit. For those whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven; for those
                       whose sins you retain, they are retained.” John 20:22-23</p>
                    <p>“Our Lord Himself I saw in this venerable Sacrament . . . I felt as if my chains fell,
                      as those of St. Peter at the touch of the Divine messenger. My God, what new scenes
                      for my soul!” -St. Elizabeth Ann Seton</p>
                    <p>Christ instituted this Sacrament as an offer of mercy toward His followers. Knowing
                      that we who love Him may continue to fall, He gave His Apostles the power to forgive sins
                      (and to hold people bound to sin should they be unrepentant). This power has been handed
                      down from Christ to the Apostles and now to the bishops (the successors of the Apostles)
                      and priests today. </p>
                    <p>Through this incredible Sacrament, Christ washes away our sins. If we are contrite and
                      truly desire to amend our lives, he forgives us totally. What could be more powerful or
                      more valuable than this? Don’t be afraid to approach the confessional. Come and be
                      forgiven and healed of whatever sins you may have committed. </p>
                    <p>Please see the homepage for the exact times for confession. However, whenever you
                      see one of our priests, you can always go to confession, just ask him.</p>
                    <p>For more information on First Confession, please contact the religious education
                      office at ext. 12</p>

                    <p> “But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. For this cause
                      shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; And they twain
                      shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore
                      God hath joined together, let not man put asunder” Mark 10:6-9</p>
                    <p>“It takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God,
                      people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing
                      else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central
                      loyalty, life is unfinished.”  Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen</p>
                    <p>Marriage is a sacrament of the Catholic Church and is the union of one man and one
                      woman for as long as the two shall live. This holy sacrament is an icon, an image,
                      a representation of the love and union between Christ and His Church – a union which
                      can never be broken.</p>
                    <p>Please make arrangements a year in advance by contacting the parish office at ext. 10.</p>

                    <p>“Go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven;
                      and come, follow me.” Matthew 19:21</p>
                    <p>“And the Lord gave me brothers.”  St. Francis of Assisi</p>
                    <p>“Our vocation is to embrace the hearts of all men, to do what the Son of God did,
                      he who came into the world to set it on fire. It is true therefore that I am sent
                      not only to love God but to make Him loved. It is not enough to love God if my neighbor
                      does not love Him.” St. Vincent de Paul</p>
                    <p>“He who wishes for anything but Christ, does not know what he wishes; he who asks
                      for anything but Christ, does not know what he is asking; he who works, and not for
                      Christ, does not know what he is doing.” St. Philip Neri</p>
                    <p>The sacrament of Holy Orders is the initiation into the priesthood of Jesus Christ.
                      Originally bestowed by Christ upon the Apostles, it is known as the “sacrament of
                      apostolic ministry”.  When a man receives this sacrament, he is ordained into one,
                      two or all of three designations: the episcopate, the priesthood, and/or the diaconate.</p>
                    <p>Those young men called by Christ to be His priest are called to give up all to follow
                      after Him with devotion and hearts aflame with love for Him. Christ invites, He calls,
                      He beckons us by speaking deeply in our hearts, all we need to do is embrace Him and
                      follow Him with courage and love. Are you being called? Do you have the courage and
                      generosity to say “yes” to Him?</p>
                    <p>Make sure to find a good faithful and joyful priest to help you discern and pray, pray, pray!</p>
                    <p>For more information about the priesthood or religious vocations, please contact the parish
                      priests at extension 10 or send an email and we will respond as soon as possible. </p>
