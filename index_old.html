                <p>Dear Brothers and Sisters,</p>
                <p>Welcome to St. Anthony's!</p>
                <p>You will notice at the top of this page that it says, "Go make disciples!" This is our church's mission statement. In fact this mission, given to the disciples by the Lord Jesus, is the mission of the entire Catholic Church.</p>
        <p>Undertaking this command of Jesus is twofold. First, it means that our own hearts have been transformed by His mercy and love because how could we offer to others what we have not received ourselves? This is only possible by first opening to Him who stands knocking at the door of our hearts. In time, this encounter grows and deepens through the great treasures He has given us through His Holy Church. Celebrating these gifts with a spirit of reverence, love and awe allows a space for the Holy Spirit to set our hearts on fire with Faith, Hope and Charity.</p>
        <p>Then, once receiving, how could we keep the flame of his love all to ourselves? This fire which purifies, warms and enlightens, is meant to be spread and to grow brighter until the whole world knows Him and is set ablaze with His goodness and love. And so, we set out with hearts on fire, in our own little way, to bring the light of Christ into the world. Ultimately, it is not our work but, by His grace, we are made participants with Him in the salvation of our neighbor. What greater joy could there be than this?</p>
        <p>So then, brothers and sister, rooted in the richness of our Catholic Faith, we set out together to transform the world one person at a time. Come and let us set out together.</p>
        <p>With much love and affection,</p><p>Fr. Al</p>

                    <p>"For me prayer is a surge of the heart, it is a simple look towards Heaven, it is a cry of recognition and of love, embracing both trial and joy." St. Therese of Lisieux</p>

<p>A novena is a prayer, or series of prayers, that is associated with a specific devotion or liturgical celebration. Novenas can be offered for a specific intention, like the healing of a sick person, for a special grace, or to give thanks to God.</p>

<p>The origins of novenas come from sacred scripture. After the Ascension, Jesus commanded His disciples to gather in the upper room and devote themselves to constant prayer (Acts 1:14). They prayed for nine days until the Holy Sprit came descended upon them on Pentecost. The word novena comes from the Latin word 'novem', meaning nine. Many novenas are prayed for nine days; either one day a week for nine weeks or every day for nine days. Other novenas are prayed throughout the year.</p>

                    <p>“The Blessed Virgin was standing on a globe, and her face was beautiful beyond words. Her fingers were covered with precious jewels whose light dazzled me. And I heard: ‘Behold the symbol of the graces I shed upon those who ask for them!’ Then an oval frame formed around the Blessed Virgin and I read in letters of gold: ‘O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee.’ The vision reversed and I beheld the letter ‘M’ surmounted by a cross, at the foot of the cross, a bar, and below all, the Heart of Jesus crowned with thorns, and the Heart of Mary pierced with a sword. A voice said to me, ‘Have a medal struck after this model. Persons who wear it will receive great graces, especially if they wear it around the neck.'” St. Catherine Laboure</p>

<p>On July 18, 1830, the Blessed Mother appeared to St. Catherine Laboure, who was a Daughter of Charity. She said, "Come to the foot of the altar; there graces will be shed upon all, great and little, who ask for them. Graces will be especially shed upon those who ask for them."</p>

<p>The Blessed Mother appeared to St. Catherine again on November 27, 1830. In this apparition, Mary was standing on a globe, her hands outstretched with brilliant light radiating from her fingers. Around her was the inscription, “O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee.” </p>

<p>Mary then instructed St. Catherine, "Have a medal struck upon this model. Those who wear it will receive great graces, especially if they wear it around the neck." </p>

<p>From this vision, the Miraculous Medal was born. The Miraculous Medal Novena is a set of prayers which comes from the Central Association of the Miraculous Medal.</p>

<p>The Miraculous Medal Novena is prayed communally after the 7:30am Mass on Mondays.</p>

                    <p>"The life of the body is the soul; the life of the soul is God." -St Anthony</p>

<p>St. Anthony of Padua is one of the most loved and admired saints in the Catholic Church. Born into a wealthy family in Portugal, he joined the Franciscan Order in 1220.  It was a lifelong dream of St. Anthony to become a martyr for his religious beliefs. He is best known for his work in Padua, Italy. St. Anthony proclaimed the Catholic faith with such beautiful simplicity, that even small children could comprehend his teachings. His uncomplicated interpretation of Catholic doctrine earned him the distinction of Doctor of the Church. </p>

<p>While St. Anthony is often invoked to help us find lost items, he is also known as the patron saint of the elderly, travelers, sailors, and the hungry.</p>

                    <p>St. Anthony's feast day celebrated on June 13.</p>

<p>The St. Anthony Novena is prayed communally after the 7:30am Mass on Tuesdays. We joyfully pray this novena out of love to honor our parish patron saint.</p>

                <p>This beautiful icon illustrates the great love shared between mother and child. Mary, the first disciple of our Lord, stayed with Him all the way to the cross. </p>

<p>In this novena we thank her and petition her to pray for us in our need and suffering and the need and suffering of those we love. In a particular way, we ask her prayers that we too might be faithful to her son, all the way to the cross.</p>

<p>The novena to Our Lady of Perpetual Help is prayed after Mass on Saturday morning.

                    <p>As can be deduced from the gospel texts, Joseph's marriage to Mary is the juridical basis of his fatherhood. It was to assure fatherly protection for Jesus that God chose Joseph to be Mary's spouse. It follows that Joseph's fatherhood - a relationship that places him as close as possible to Christ, to whom every election and predestination is ordered (cf. Rom 8:28-29) - comes to pass through marriage to Mary, that is, through the family.
While clearly affirming that Jesus was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit, and that virginity remained intact in the marriage (cf. Mt 1:18-25; Lk 1:26-38), the evangelists refer to Joseph as Mary's husband and to Mary as his wife (cf. Mt 1:16, 18-20, 24; Lk 1:27; 2:5).

                    <p> “Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. Rejoice then, O heaven and you that dwell therein! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!"
                        The Book of Revelation 12: 1-12 </p>

<p>The prayer to St. Michael the Archangel which we say together is the shorter version of the prayer composed by Pope Leo XIII. After saying Mass one day in the Vatican chapel attended by some Cardinals and others on the Vatican staff,  an dramatic incident happened in the life of Pope Leo XIII.  He was in leaving the altar when he suddenly collapsed to the floor and awoke saying "Oh, what a horrible picture I was permitted to see."  He had witnessed a struggle between Satan and the Church, in which Satan bragged he could destroy her.  But Pope Leo was relieved to see that Satan would not triumph because St. Michael would be there to consign him to the abyss of hell.  Not long after this experience he composed this prayer which used to be said after every low Mass through the Catholic world.  We join the voices to faithful Catholics who have prayed their prayer for an end to the horrors in the world, especially those committed against the Church and our Christian brothers and sisters. </p>

<p>The prayer to St. Michael is prayed after Mass on Thursday and Friday.

                    <p>“Give me an army saying the Rosary and I will conquer the world.”
                        Pope Blessed Pius IX</p>

<p>“The Rosary is the most beautiful and the most rich in graces of all prayers; it is the prayer that touches most the Heart of the Mother of God…and if you wish peace to reign in your homes, recite the family Rosary.” -Pope Saint Pius X</p>

<p>The word Rosary means "Crown of Roses". Our Lady has revealed to several people that each time they say a Hail Mary they are giving her a beautiful rose and that each complete Rosary makes her a crown of roses. The rose is the queen of flowers, and so the Rosary is the rose of all devotions and it is therefore the most important one. The Holy Rosary is considered a perfect prayer because within it lies the awesome story of our salvation. With the Rosary in fact we meditate the mysteries of joy, of sorrow and the glory of Jesus and Mary. It's a simple prayer, humble so much like Mary. It's a prayer we can all say together with Her, the Mother of God. With the Hail Mary we invite Her to pray for us. Our Lady always grants our request. She joins Her prayer to ours. Therefore it becomes ever more useful, because what Mary asks She always receives, Jesus can never say no to whatever His Mother asks for. In every apparition, the heavenly Mother has invited us to say the Rosary as a powerful weapon against evil, to bring us to true peace. With your prayer made together with Your heavenly Mother, you can obtain the great gift of bringing about a change of hearts and conversion. Each day, through prayer you can drive away from yourselves and from your homeland many dangers and many evils.</p>

<p>The Rosary is prayed every Friday after the morning Mass and also during our First Friday Holy Hour.

                    <dt>The Seven Sacraments of the Church</dt>
                    <dd>The seven sacraments are: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. The seven sacraments touch all stages and all the important moments of Christian life. They give birth and increase, healing and mission to the Christian's life of Faith. There is thus a certain resemblance between the stages of natural life and the stages of spiritual life.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                <dt>Sacraments of Christian Initiation</dt>
                <dd>The Sacraments of Christian Initiation-Baptism, Confirmation and the Eucharist lay the foundations of every Christian life. The faithful are born anew by Baptism, strengthened by the sacrament of Confirmation, and receive in the Eucharist the food of eternal life. By means of these sacraments of Christian Initiation, they thus receive in increasing measure the treasures of the divine life and advance toward perfection of charity.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                <dt>Baptism</dt>
                <dd>Holy Baptism is the basis of the whole Christian life, the gateway to life in the Spirit, and the door which gives access to the other sacraments. Baptism is the Sacrament by which we are initiated into the life of Christ and become a member of God's household. Baptism may take place at any age after proper catechetical instruction. For Adults this process is through R.C.I.A. (Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults). For Children of Catechetical Age (7 or older) this process is through R.C.I.C. (Rite of Christian Initiation of Children). Parents of infants or small children are required to attend a baptismal instruction class. After attending the class they may call the parish office and arrange a date for the Baptism.

The Catholic Church requires 2 Sponsors for Baptism, commonly referred to as “Godparents.” The Church asks that there be one male sponsor and one female sponsor. At least one of these must be a Catholic who has received the sacraments of baptism, confirmation, Eucharist and be at least 16 years of age. If the individual is married they must have been married in a Catholic Ceremony recognized by the Catholic Church. If you choose one of the sponsors who is not a Catholic that person must be a Christian who has received the Sacrament of Baptism. They are not properly speaking, a sponsor or godparent but referred to as a “Christian Witness.”
The purpose of the sponsor is to assist the child in the development of their faith. For this reason you are asked to choose someone who practices their faith and not simply as an award to a faithful friend or relative. Once a godparent has been chosen and the baptism has been performed the record cannot be altered later if you have a falling out with the godparent or Christian witness. You are urged to take this seriously and choose wisely.
Should you have a special circumstance, for example a teenage pregnancy, an older child, a child with a disability, etc. please speak with the Pastor.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                <dt>Confirmation</dt>
                <dd>Baptism, the Eucharist, and the sacrament of Confirmation together constitute the "sacraments of Christian Initiation", whose unity must be safeguarded. It must be explained to the faithful that the reception of the sacrament of Confirmation is necessary for the completion of baptismal grace. For "by the sacrament of Confirmation, [the baptized] are more perfectly bound to the Church and are enriched with a special strength of the Holy Spirit. Hence they are, as true witnesses, of Christ, more strictly obliged to spread and defend the faith by word and deed."
Confirmation is a two year catechetical program overseen by the Director of Religious Education. It begins in 7th grade and runs through the entire 8th Grade. In the student's freshman year, usually September, they attend a retreat in preparation for reception of the Sacrament in October of the same year. In preparation for the Sacrament the students receive Catechetical instruction, perform community service, attend a retreat and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation.
Older Children or adults should call the Director of the R.C.I.A. (Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults) program to complete their sacraments.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                <dt>First Eucharist</dt>
                <dd>In the organic whole, the Eucharist occupies a unique place as the "Sacrament of Sacraments": all other sacraments are ordered to it as to their end. The Eucharist is "the source and summit of the Christian life". The other sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are oriented toward it. For in the blessed Eucharist is contained the whole spiritual good of the Church, namely Christ Himself.
The reception of First Eucharist follows adequate Catechetical instruction, usually in the second grade level. Children first receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation, generally during the Penitential Season of Lent. First Eucharist is celebrated on the Sunday's following Easter at a Mass held in the afternoon. Every Catholic is encouraged to receive communion weekly at Sunday Mass and they are urged to make a frequent good confession, especially if in a state of Mortal Sin. It is fitting that First Eucharist be received during the Easter Season. Due to the large number of children receiving, each child will be assigned a particular date by the Office of Religious Education. Your cooperation is appreciated. Children may wear any clean and 'dressy' clothing of any color. There is no requirement for headwear, footwear or bodywear beyond being neat, clean and presentable.</dd>

                <dl>
                <dt>Sacraments of Healing</dt>
                <dd>Through the sacraments of Christian initiation, man receives the new life of Christ. Now we carry this life "in earthen vessels," and it remains "hidden with Christ in God." We are still in our "earthly tent," subject to suffering, illness, and death. This new life as a child of God can be weakened and even lost by sin. The Lord Jesus Christ, physician of our souls and bodies, who forgave the sins of the paralytic and restored him to bodily health, has willed that his Church continue, in the power of the Holy Spirit, his work of healing and salvation, even among her own members. This is the purpose of the two sacraments of healing: the sacrament of Penance and the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick. </dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                <dt>Sacrament of Penance</dt>
                <dd>Confessions are held on Saturdays throughout the year, with the exception of Holy Saturday from 4:00 pm - 4:30 pm and extended hours during the sacred season of Lent. The Reconciliation room has options for face-to-face or behind the screen confessions. </dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                <dt>Annointing of the Sick</dt>
                <dd>By the sacred anointing of the sick and the prayer of the priests the whole Church commends those who are ill to the suffering and glorified Lord, that he may raise them up and save them. The reception of this sacrament is available to any Catholic who finds themselves in grave physical, spiritual or mental state of illness. Arrangements should be made through the parish office for those who are homebound. If after hours, or on weekends, and the person is in imminent danger of death, leave a message. The phone is checked periodically throughout the day. If you are having surgery you may ask a priest to anoint you before the surgery. Call the office to schedule an appointment. Please do not arrange for someone else to be anointed unless you are immediately related to the person in need and know they desire to receive the sacrament. This avoids embarrassing the priest and the ill person avoiding an otherwise awkward situation. Please note: It is best not to wait until the very last moment to call for a priest. There are situations when no priest is available and might be several hours away from responding.</dd>

                <dl>
                <dt>Sacraments at the service of communion and mission of the faithful</dt>
                <dd>Two other sacraments, Holy Orders and Matrimony, are directed towards the salvation of others; if they contribute as well to personal salvation, it is through service to others that they do so. They confer a particular mission in the Church and serve to build up the People of God. Through these sacraments those already consecrated by Baptism and Confirmation for the common priesthood of all the faithful can receive particular consecrations. Those who receive the sacrament of Holy Orders are Consecrated in Christ's name "to feed the church by the Word and grace of God." On their part, "Christian spouses are fortified and, as it were, consecrated for their duties and dignity of their state by a special sacrament."</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                <dt>Holy Orders</dt>
                <dd>Holy Orders is the sacrament through which the mission entrusted by Christ to His apostles continues to be exercised in the Church until the end of time: thus it is the sacrament of apostolic ministry. It includes three degrees: episcopate, presbyterate, and diaconate. This Sacrament has three degrees within it: Diaconate (Permanent and Transitional), Priests and Bishops. Those who feel called to the Order of Deacon may contact the Pastor to discern the Call to this vital ministry in the Church. The permanent Diaconate is open to married or single men over the age of 35 who have gone through the Trenton Diocese Diaconate Classes (currently a 4 year program).
Those men who are not married who wish to pursue studies to the priesthood may contact the of the Diocese of Trenton at 609-393-2801 or view information on the web site www.godiscallingyou.com. The Office of Vocations also has an interactive CD- Rom available and regular discernment meetings held monthly throughout the Diocese. The Diocese also has a House of Formation for those men not sure or who are in transition in preparation for Seminary.</dd>

                <dl>
                <dt>Marriage</dt>
                <dd>The Parish follows the Common Policy for Marriage for the Province of New Jersey. The Catholic Church of New Jersey has the same policies throughout the State by agreement of the Bishop's of New Jersey. Those wishing to Marry must contact the Pastor at least one year in advance. You must be a registered member of the Parish. No “wedding date” is discussed until an initial meeting with the pastor is successfully completed and it has been determined that both bride and groom are free to marry in the Catholic Church. As part of the preparation for this lifetime commitment the couple has four instructional meetings. They are administered the FOCUS instrument to assist them in a assessing the strength's and weaknesses of their relationship. They are required to attend a Pre-Cana instruction taught by married couples of the Parish. Since Marriage is a Sacrament and a religious institution the ceremony is a thoroughly Catholic one. The introduction of secular, pagan, superstitions or cultural practices are not permitted, this includes the music. Please call the Parish Office for more information.</dd>
